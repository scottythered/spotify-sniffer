# Slowstart Guide for Code Newbies
We'll try to take it slow and easy for people who want to use Sniffer but haven't done much of this coding stuff, right?

## Set Up
1. **Do you have Python?**
Python is a programming language, and you'll need it to run Sniffer. Check to see if Python is installed by going into your command line interface (on Mac, this is 'Terminal'; on Windows, this is 'Command Prompt', or *cmd*), typing in ```python --version``` and hitting enter or return. The CLI will either return a program version or an error message if it's not installed.

Note: You'll need Python 3.6 or later to run Sniffer, and some systems have this installed as ```python3```, so try:
```
scottythered:~$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.6
```
There's lots of resources out there if you need to install Python3 to your machine.

2. **Do you have Spotify API credentials?**
